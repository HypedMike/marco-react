 Keep all your links in a safe place and organize them however you want

You can find all the settings inside "data/":

- links.json -> here you organize your links. You can set a name displayed on the button, a link and an image. You don't need to add an image and I would suggest to add not more tha 1 anyway. You can upload the picture in the folder "img/"

- name.txt -> here to change your name

- img/pp.jpg -> this is the main profile picture, upload a 1:1 jpg picture with this exact name to change the current profile picture
